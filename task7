Scaling:

Here we are going to discuss two types of Scaling:

  1. Manual Scaling
  2. Auto Scaling

Task 1: Auto Scaling

Create project p3



Create a deployment



Check the replicaset, pods and deployment status



 Set pod/container resource request and resource limit to myapp7 deployment

--requests=cpu=100m --limits=cpu=500m
 
 Verify it by describing the deployment or pod



 Now Scale up deployment pods if pod cpu usage hit more than 10%. in this case add pods between minimum 2 and maximum 10
 So we are saying here that autoscaling can max scale upto 10 pods if needed and decreased to 2 pods.



 Validate HPA (autoscaling)


Validate numer of pods you see Now




Now let's put some load on the pod container by sending some trafic to the application container

# oc run load-generator6 --image=busybox --   sh -c "while true; do wget -q -O- http://autoscale-demo.default.svc.cluster.local; done"

After Couple of minutes Check the replicaset count or pods and hpa
