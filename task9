1) create project p5

2) deploy application app5 using image nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged

3) Check the status of pod

4) check the Allocateable memory on your node

5) now set the resource requests with higher memory than what your cluster node has in Allocatable

   # oc set resources deployment app5 --limits=cpu=200m,memory=40Gi --requests=cpu=100m,memory=30Gi


6) check the pod status, if it's in pending . troubleshoot it.

   Hint: you can edit the deployment 
         Or generate new yaml file by using below command, make changes there and then apply

         
           
           vi app5.yaml

           change memory number to 1Gi under requests

           save&quit

           

7) Now the check the pod status
